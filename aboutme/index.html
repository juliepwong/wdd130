        <p>Hi everyone. My name is Julie Wong. Some people call me jewels.I am in my Junior year of BYU-I.</p>
        <p>My major is Professional Studies with a bachelors in science. The career I hope to get with my major would be in designing.</p> 
        <p>Some things that I love to do is spend time with my friends and family. Some of the things that we like to dofor fun would</p>
        <p>be go to the movies and to Disneyland for special occasions. Currently I work for my local school district as an instructional</p>
        <p>assistant for special needs kids. I think once I finish school. I would like to find a better job. What I love most about</p>
        <p>BYU-Idaho is that I can study remotely and finish my degree with the certificates in Social Media Marketing, Graphic Design,</p>
        <p>and Web Frontend Design. Some of the advantages that I see from learning about careers in web design is that it can help</p>
        <p>better my future in finding a better job. I am taking this class to complete the requirements for my Front End Web Design</p>
        <p>certificate. I will use what I learn to help others in possibly designing a website for them. I have been a member of the</p>
        <p>church my whole life. I don't have a favorite quote, but my favorite scripture is D&C 68:6.</p>
